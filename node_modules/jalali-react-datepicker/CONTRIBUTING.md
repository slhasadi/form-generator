## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the all contributors specification. To add yourself to the table of contributors on the README.md, please use the automated script as part of your PR.

```console
npm run contributors:add
```

Follow the prompt and commit `.all-contributorsrc` and `README.md` in the PR.
If you've already added yourself to the list and are making
a new type of contribution, you can run it again and select the added
contribution type.

Please make sure to run the tests before you commit your changes. You can run
